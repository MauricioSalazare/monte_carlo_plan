# Monte Carlo simulation on a distribution grid using multivariate elliptical copulas

This project uses HPC implemented on a parallel cluster on AWS to run monte carlo simulations in a medium voltage 
distribution grid.

## Load modelling
Load models comes from a multivariate elliptical copual which simulates different levels of 
active and reactive power consumption.
